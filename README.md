    Big Sticky Note


    This utility is a sticky note:  Instead of using Post-It or other notes, this utility is always available
    and is always with me, even if I work from home or a coffee shop.

    To open the note, Click Win-N.  To close, hit ESC.

    The tool also supports reminders:   Any line that contains a "@Date" or "@Time" indication will 
    notify the user using Tray Tip, at the given day (every 30 minutes) or the given hour (every day,
    twice during the hour).  To use, enter a reminder time like this:
                @Monday Call John
                @16:00 Daily summary  (Note that the reminder is on the hour, not the exact time.  It might 
                                        alert anytime between 16:00 and 17:00)
                @23/03 Send my report   

    The note is automatically saved in a text file.  10 historical copies are saved, so you can manually
    revert to older versions, by renaming the file.
